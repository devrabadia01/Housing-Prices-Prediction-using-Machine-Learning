# Housing-Prices-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This project predicts housing sale prices using a Kaggle dataset by building and evaluating machine learning models. The aim is to estimate property prices based on house features.
Key features:

EDA & Visualization: Explored variable distributions, missing data, and correlations affecting price.

Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering: Handled missing values, created new features (e.g., total area), transformed skewed variables.

Model Development: Trained and compared Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost models for price prediction.

Model Evaluation: Used RMSE and RÂ² to assess performance, selecting the best predictive model.

Insights: Identified top price predictors (overall quality, area, location) and explained their influence.

Repository contains Jupyter notebooks, cleaned datasets, model outputs, and documentation.
